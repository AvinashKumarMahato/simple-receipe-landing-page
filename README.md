## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned the importance of a mobile-first approach and how to effectively use Flexbox for layout management. Additionally, I improved my skills in creating responsive designs that adapt well to different screen sizes.




## Continued development
In future projects, I plan to continue focusing on responsive design and improving my use of CSS Grid for more complex layouts. I also want to deepen my understanding of accessibility best practices to ensure my sites are usable for everyone.
